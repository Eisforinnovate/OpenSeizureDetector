# Seizure Detectors
* [Dravet Foundation's EIC BBK](http://www.eicbbk.org/programa-deteccion-nocturna-de-crisis-epilepticas) - They are working on a project with exactly the same goals as this, so I am hopeful that we will be able to colaborate on algoriths etc., even if the projects remain separate.
* [My Accelerometer Based Prototype](https://github.com/jones139/OpenSeizureDetector/tree/master/accelerometer_version).
* Links to some commercial bed/mattress based seizure detectors are provided [here](http://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/alarms-and-safety-aids#.UwfYeR-trVM).
