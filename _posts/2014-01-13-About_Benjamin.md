Benjamin is 17 (born 1996) and has severe learning difficulties, does not 
talk at all and is <a href="http://autism.org.uk">autistic<a>.
Among other issues he has 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy">epilepsy</a>.   
His epilepsy is generally well controlled with 
medication (he has a couple of seizures a year), but when he does have a seizure
it tends to be a big one (tonic-clonic or grand-mal - the classic limb shaking
eplleptic seizure).

Last time he had one he stopped breathing completely and we ended up
resuscitating him followed by a blue light trip to hospital.

I installed a simple analogue video monitor system in our house when he started
having fits so we can keep an eye on him to make sure he is ok.   I just 
happened to notice his last fit because I looked up while we were having
breakfast and thought his movement looked a bit odd on the screen.   This is
fine, but you have to be looking at the screen for it to be any use.

This got me thinking that it would be good to have something that would raise
an alarm to tell us he was having a fit, rather than relying on us watching
a monitor.  So in about February 2013 I started work on a seizure detector for
Benjamin, and this project is the result (I don't do anything quickly!).
