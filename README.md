OpenSeizureDetector
===================

A suite of open source and open hardware projects designed to detect and alert people to someone suffering from an epileptic seizure (fit).   This is a work in progress at the moment, and three different technologies are being developed to see which work best: Accelerometers, Audio Detection and Video Detection.
