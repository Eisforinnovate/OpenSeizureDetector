benFinder
=========

My first go at using a kinect depth sensor to find benjamin in an image of his
bedroom - the first stage of spotting odd behaviour that may be indicative
of a seizure.

The application framework used is based on the excellent introductory book
about using Python and opencv "OpenCV Computer Vision with Python" by
Joseph Howse (http://www.packtpub.com/opencv-computer-vision-with-python/book).
