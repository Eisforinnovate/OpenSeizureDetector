benFinder
=========

My first go at using a kinect depth sensor to find benjamin in an image of his
bedroom - the first stage of spotting odd behaviour that may be indicative
of a seizure.

The application framework used is based on the excellent introductory book
about using Python and opencv "OpenCV Computer Vision with Python" by
Joseph Howse (http://www.packtpub.com/opencv-computer-vision-with-python/book).

Note:
To convert the video output (screencast.avi) to a more compressed file, use:
>>  avconv -i screencast.avi -f avi -c:v mpeg4 -b:v 800k -g 300 -bf 2 example.avi
(I don't know what this is really doing, but it reduced a 900MB screencast.avi
to a 6.8MB compressed file - there is some loss of quality, but not bad).
